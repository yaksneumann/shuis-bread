          <h2>🌴 The Beginning in Hollywood, Florida</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Our story begins in the vibrant coastal city of Hollywood, Florida, where the warm Atlantic 
          breezes and diverse culinary culture first sparked a passion for baking. Growing up surrounded 
          by the rich flavors of South Florida's melting pot of cultures, our baker developed an early 
          appreciation for authentic, handcrafted foods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The journey into bread making started in a small home kitchen, experimenting with simple 
          recipes and learning the fundamentals of working with flour, water, and wild yeast. Those 
          early days in Florida taught the importance of patience, precision, and the magic that 
          happens when time and temperature work together.

          <h2>✈️ The Great Adventure to Israel</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The call to explore ancestral roots and connect with ancient baking traditions led to a 
          life-changing move to Israel. This wasn't just a geographic relocation—it was a culinary 
          pilgrimage to the land where bread has been central to daily life for thousands of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Israel's bustling markets and family bakeries, new techniques were discovered and old 
          traditions were learned firsthand. From Jerusalem's Old City to Tel Aviv's modern neighborhoods, 
          every corner offered a new lesson in the art of bread making.

          Today, our bread combines the best of both worlds—the innovative spirit of Florida with 
          the ancient wisdom of Middle Eastern baking. Every loaf tells a story of this incredible journey.
